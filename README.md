# ETL Project using Python & MySQL


## Overview
The project aims to perform ETL operation using Python and Mysql workbench. Firstly, the orders data is extracted from kaggle into the python jupyter notebook where the data is tranformed and cleaned and then finally it is loaded into the mysql workbench where data analysis is done to get valuable insights using window functions and cte's.


## Libraries Required
kaggle --> to connect to kaggle dataset  

zipfile --> to extract files from zip folder

pandas --> for data analysis and cleaning

pymysql & sqlalchemy --> for connecting from notebook to mysql workbench



## Data Understanding 

Dataset --> [Orders.csv](https://github.com/Sathyam-Kakodkar/Python_Mysql_Project/blob/main/Dataset/orders.csv)
